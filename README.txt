This project seeks to solve the issue my roommates being locked out of our apartment because they forgot to bring their keys with them...
Currently only available on Android, but iOS is coming!

This repository contains the android studio project for the autodoor application. The application requires the user to input the
appropriate passcode that is hard coded into the arduino microcontroller with a bluetooth low energy shield. The arduino operates a servo
motor that is capable of turning the deadbolt on our door. Youtube video to come!
